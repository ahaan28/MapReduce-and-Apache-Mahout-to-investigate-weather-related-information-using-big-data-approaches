This project uses MapReduce and Apache Mahout to investigate textual and weather-related information using big data approaches.  Using a mapper to extract date-wind speed pairings and a reducer to determine maximum-minimum differences, the first task examines wind speed data and calculates daily variations, revealing weather oscillations.  The second tas, which determines the daily minimum humidity, shows a noticeable anomaly along with generally dry weather.  The third task highlights patterns in atmospheric moisture by computing the mean and variance of the dew point temperature.  A correlation matrix for temperature, wind speed, and humidity is created in the fourth job.

The second question compares Euclidean, Manhattan, and Cosine distance metrics after applying K-Means clustering to French tragedy texts and converting them into TF-IDF vectors.  Cosine distance offers better cluster quality, while the elbow approach determines the ideal number of clusters.  The results advance our understanding of environmental and textual data analysis by showcasing scalable data processing capabilities and providing insightful information about weather trends and the effectiveness of text clustering.
